* Output processor.

This program takes an output from hermes in the form of part.out.NNNN and parses it.
The basis is the superclass in processor.pm, which can be extended for any purpose.

here are two examples:


| processClassSha1.pl              | Extracts the sha of the class file and its corresponding signature only |
| processClassExtractSigsUnique.pl | Extracts each signature once. Uses a database of signatures             |


** processClassExtractSigsUnique.pl

The output of this program is one line per defined object in a
class. it can be a class, a method or an attribute. 

For a class it outputs:

| sha1            | the sha of the file                           |
| cLA             | it is a class                                 |
| className       |                                               |

| classPublic     |                                               |

| path            | full path of the .class file                  |
| basename        | is name                                       |
| ext             | its extension                                 |
| sha1Inside      | sha1 of file where it was found               |
| depth           | depth of class file in packages (starts at 0) |
| compiledFrom    | compiled from line in decompilation           | 

For methods or attributes

| dataSha            | Shat of the entire signature of the class   |
| mET or fIE         | is method or attribute(field)               |
| sha1               | sha1 of file                                |
