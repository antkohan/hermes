* Output processor.

This program takes an output from hermes in the form of part.out.NNNN and parses it.
The basis is the superclass in processor.pm, which can be extended for any purpose.

here are two examples:


| processClassSha1.pl              | Extracts the sha of the class file and its corresponding signature only |
| processClassExtractSigsUnique.pl | Extracts each signature once. Uses a database of signatures             |
